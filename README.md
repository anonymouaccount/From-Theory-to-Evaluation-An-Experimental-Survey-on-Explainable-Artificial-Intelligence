# From-Theory-to-Evaluation-An-Experimental-Survey-on-Explainable-Artificial-Intelligence
Code and resources for the experimental evaluation presented in the survey on Explainable AI (XAI).
This repository contains the experimental code and resources used in the survey paper titled **"From Theory to Evaluation: An Experimental Survey on Explainable Artificial Intelligence"**.

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

We evaluate explainability methods across various data modalities:
- Image Data
- Text Data
- Tabular Data
- Graph Data
- Time-Series Data

The experiments benchmark multiple XAI techniques such as:
- Grad-CAM
- CAM
- LIME
- SHAP
- DeepLIFT
- GNNExplainer
- GraphLIME
- XGNN
- PyXAI

Evaluation is based on quantitative metrics:
- Fidelity
- Stability
- Sparsity
- Robustness
